# Roadmap

OpenBox is maintained by one person in the open, so the roadmap is short and honest: what is in the current release, what is being worked on, and where new ideas come from. There are no dates and no promises beyond that.

## In the current release

The [changelog](/changelog/) is the accurate record. The headline pieces in 0.8.x are box art that keeps its natural aspect ratio (covers are no longer cropped into a single frame, so games with non-standard artwork like SNES titles display uncropped), the persistent play queue with normalized tags, the Notification Center, signed webhook automation, and handheld performance profiles that apply TDP via `ryzenadj` on Deck and battery-powered handhelds.

## In progress

The Unreleased section of the app changelog tracks the next batch. Right now no new items are committed there; the queue, tags, notifications, and webhook surfaces from the previous Unreleased list shipped in 0.8.2. New ideas come from the sources below.

## Where ideas come from

- GitHub issues, using the feature request template. The maintainer triages these directly.
- The [parity matrix](/reference/parity/), which tracks LaunchBox workflows and what is intentionally not replicated on Linux.
- The community: the project is open source (AGPL-3.0), and contributions that follow [Contributing](/project/contributing/) are welcome.

## What will not happen

A few things are ruled out by design, not just postponed: no OpenBox account, no cloud library, no telemetry, no subscription, and no bundling of games, ROMs, or BIOS files. If a request requires one of those, it will not be built.
